Widgets
Widgets enable users to interact with an Android Studio application page. There are various kinds of widgets, such as Buttons and TextViews. 
To see all the widgets at your disposal, create a new application project called “Widgets” and select "empty activity".
The main purpose of a control widget is to display often used functions that the user can trigger right from the home screen without having to open the app first.
Think of widgets as remote controls for an app.
Tap and hold the widget and then drop it back in place
A colored border should appear, along with tabs situated around the sides of the widget
Tap and hold any of these colored tabs and drag out or inwards
Alternatively, tap the menu button and hit “Edit” before following the above instructions
Home screen widgets are broadcast receivers which provide interactive components
They are primarily used on the Android home screen.
They typically display some kind of data and allow the user to perform actions with them.
